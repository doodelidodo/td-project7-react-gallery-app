## React Gallery App

This is the 7th project from my Treehouse Techdegree and also my first React App. It calls via api from flicker images
and present them on the page. There is also a search feature to search another topic. 

### How to install and start the app:

First you need to install all packages:

### `npm install`

then you need to run the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
